# 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Hunting Playbooks for APT Activity

Welcome to the **APT Threat Hunting Playbooks** repository — a curated collection of **true, intelligence-driven threat hunts** built for defenders, threat hunters, and detection engineers. These playbooks are designed to proactively uncover stealthy adversary behavior in your environment **without relying on alerts**.

---

**Threat hunting** is proactive. It starts with a hypothesis — not an alert. You assume an adversary may already be inside the network and systematically test that assumption using logs, telemetry, and known TTPs. There is no signature. There is no SIEM correlation rule. Just visibility, logic, and adversary understanding.

**SOC alerts** are reactive. They rely on predefined detection rules firing when known bad behavior is observed. Alerts tell you something already happened — threat hunting is about finding what hasn’t been caught yet.


## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides **assumption-based threat hunt chains** focused on real-world adversaries such as **APT29, APT41, APT10, FIN6, and APT27**. Each hunt breaks down known TTPs into **actionable steps** using:

- Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon telemetry
- Authentication records
- File, process, and network artifacts
- Hypothesis-driven methodology

---

## 🧠 Methodology

Each hunt follows this structure:

- **🎯 Objective** — What behavior are we trying to uncover?
- **✅ Hypothesis** — What are we assuming the adversary is doing?
- **🧱 Tactics to Focus On** — ATT&CK-style breakdown of scope
- **🔍 Hunt Chain** — Step-by-step investigation flow using logs
- **💡 Thought Process** — Why the step matters, what to ask yourself
- **🧠 Summary** — What you’ve accomplished and what to do next
